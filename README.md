# Multiclass-U-Net-for-Fetal-Feature-Extraction
Built a Multiclass U-Net Model for deep learning based segmentation mode capable  of identifying the structures of the fetal transventricular plane
Upon using the "ipynb" notebook the results can be following results can be achieved
## Multiclass U-Net Model

### The whole model has been implemented in the ipynb file from scratch with the help of TensorFlow 2.0 and Keras

## For judging the performance Dice coefficient was used


The formula for Dice coefficient is =  2 * the Area of Overlap divided by the total number of pixels in both images. and is used mostly for segmentation problems

### Dice Coefficient Graph Achieved
